# *geolocationd* IPC protocol

The program *geolocationd* implements a socket IPC protocol around
the Android GPS HAL API. This document describes the IPC protocol
used by *geolocationd.*

Clients (i.e., external software) of GPS functionality establish a
connection with *geolocationd* and send **command messages.** For
each command, *Geolocationd* replies with a **response message.**
Examples of commands are starting and stopping the location updates,
or adding location data to the GPS system.

In addition to responses, *geolocationd* also sends **notification
messages** to inform its client about external events. Examples of
notifications are GPS satellite poitions or location information.


## Connection establishment

Connections are **always** established by *geolocationd*. Supported
sockets are in the domain AF_UNIX with type SOCK_SEQPACKET. The client
shall

 1. create a compatible listen socket,
 2. set an abstract socket name,
 3. start listening on the created socket, and
 4. start *geolocationd*.

The abstract socket name (excluding the trailing \0) is supplied to
*geolocationd* via the -a command-line option. *Geolocationd* will
establish a connection to the respective socket. If no socket name
is given, the default is *geolocationd.*


## IPC protocol

The IPC protocol is PDU based. Each PDU contains exactly one message.
There are 3 types of messages:

 * commands,
 * resonses, and
 * notifications.

All PDUs have the same format

  +--------+--------+----------------+--- ... ---+
  | Service| Opcode | Payload length |  Payload  |
  +--------+--------+----------------+--- ... ---+
       8        8           16         <variable>


A **services** represents a group of messages, each **opcode** represents
a message of the service. Commands and their responses use the same opcode
and can be distinguished by the message's direction. Commands always flow
from client to daemon, responses always flow from daemon to client.

Notifications also always flow from daemon to client. They are distiguished
from responses by their opcode, which has the MSB set for all notification
messages.

The IPC protocol is intended to be compatible with the HAL protocol for
BlueZ [1].
